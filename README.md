# contract-deployments

This repo contains execution code and artifacts related to Base contract deployments, upgrades, and calls. For actual contract implementations, see [base-org/contracts](https://github.com/base-org/contracts).

This repo is structured with each network having a high-level directory which contains subdirectories of any "tasks" (contract deployments/calls) that have happened for that network.

## Validation Files

Please note, you will need to manually create validation file(s) for your task as they are bespoke to each task and therefore not created automatically as a part of the templates. We use one validation Markdown file per multisig involved in the task:

- Single multisig: Create a `VALIDATION.md` file at the root of your task
- Multiple multisigs: Create a `validations/` subdirectory at the root of your task containing the corresponding validation Markdown files

If you need examples to work from, you can browse through similar past tasks in this repo and adapt them to your specific task. Also, please note that we have tooling to generate these files (like the `task-signer-tool`) which removes the manual aspect of creating these validation files.
