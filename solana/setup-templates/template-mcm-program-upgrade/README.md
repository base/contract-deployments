# MCM Program Upgrade via Multi-Chain Multisig

Status: PENDING

## Description

This task upgrades a Solana program using the Multi-Chain Multisig (MCM) governance system. The upgrade is performed by uploading a new program buffer and creating an MCM proposal that, once signed and executed, will upgrade the program to the new version.

## Procedure for Signers

### 1. Update repo

```bash
cd contract-deployments
git pull
cd solana/<network>/<task-directory>
make deps
```

### 2. Setup Ledger

Your Ledger needs to be connected and unlocked. The **Ethereum application** needs to be opened on Ledger with the message "Application is ready".

### 3. Sign the proposal

```bash
make sign
```

This command will:
1. Display the proposal hash
2. Prompt you to sign on your Ledger
3. Output your signature

**Verify on your Ledger**: Check that the data you're signing matches the proposal hash displayed in the terminal.

After signing, you will see output like:

```
Signature: 1234567890abcdef...
```

### 4. Send signature to Facilitator

Copy the **entire signature** and send it to the Facilitator via your secure communication channel.

**That's it!** The Facilitator will collect all signatures and execute the proposal.
