## Example .env for template-safe-management (swap owner)
# Do NOT commit real secrets or production .env files.

# Commit hash of Optimism repo for building / validation
OP_COMMIT=REPLACE_WITH_COMMIT_HASH

# Commit hash of Base contracts repo for building / validation
BASE_CONTRACTS_COMMIT=REPLACE_WITH_COMMIT_HASH

# Address of the Gnosis Safe where ownership will be swapped
OWNER_SAFE=REPLACE_WITH_SAFE_ADDRESS

# Address of the current signer/owner to be removed
OLD_SIGNER=REPLACE_WITH_OLD_OWNER_ADDRESS

# Address of the new signer/owner to be added
NEW_SIGNER=REPLACE_WITH_NEW_OWNER_ADDRESS

## Notes:
#  - Ensure the new threshold remains valid after the swap
#  - Use recent commit hashes for OP_COMMIT and BASE_CONTRACTS_COMMIT
#  - Generate validation file with: make gen-validation
